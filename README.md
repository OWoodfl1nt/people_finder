Hi all, I am from London, I like taking photos and open source projects. 

Follow me on twitter: @OWoodflint

This project is a new social network for taking photos in your home town.

Project starting soon! Email me if you want to help out: message me on twitter for my email, probably not a good idea to give it out publicly
